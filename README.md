        - NextAuth authentication for spotify api:

            - https://next-auth.js.org/providers/spotify

        - We need authentication because we need an access token and also check if the access token has expired

        - If the access token has expired, then we need to refresh the expired access token with a valid refresh token.

        - Having a valid access token, authenticates the use login, without a valid access token the user cannot access the 
        website and it will always redirect that un-authenticated user to the login/signin page.

        - Once the user login/signup using their spotify account, the user is authenitcated and gets a valid access token.
